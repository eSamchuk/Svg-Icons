This wasn't perfect though as it didn't return the post-transform coordinates, but it got most of the way for what I needed.\r<br />\n<br />\nI moved the SVG (and manipulation of it) server-side via c# to avoid the user needing to download the whole SVG into their browser, and found this project while searching which looks like it is quite interesting for what I am doing. \r<br />\n<br />\nIs there a way of getting the bounding coordinates of an SVG text element using this project? If so, please could someone point me in the right direction with a couple of examples?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!\r<br />\nDavid<br />\n",
