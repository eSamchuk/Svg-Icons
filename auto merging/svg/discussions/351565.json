    "Html": "<p>I had included the renderer in one of my projects. It had been a pity no filter functions, and the gradient with Gdi+ does not seem to be compliant with svg. With limited time available, in the past months I had built up the filter functions gradually and created work arounds to improve the gradient display, and by the way fixed some bugs. It is uploaded now (ID: 11924). I am not the co-worker for this project. It is just to share if someone may want to continue the work...</p>\n<p>Most of the functions are tested&nbsp;and work well for&nbsp;&gt;95% of svg cliparts from Open ClipArt library, except below functions do not yet work properly, or are not yet implemented:</p>\n<p>- Lighting filters - works for the example in SVG 1.1 spec, but does not work properly for some other examples</p>\n<p>- BackgroundImage - not yet implemented but tentatively use device canvas as work around, still works well for most of examples</p>\n<p>- FillPaint and StrokePaint - do not quick understand them, not yet implemented</p>\n<p>- Minor color difference for ConvolveMatrix and ColorMatrix</p>\n<p>Since pixel operations with managed codes for filter functions may be slow, I had used LockBit&nbsp;in unsafe way to access bitmap. It can be much faster though not recommended in general. You may change it&nbsp;to managed code if your project does not allow it, but take care of the speed (could be very&nbsp;slow)</p>\n<p>I will still have very limited time for further work on this. If you are interested in the codes, feel free to improve it and share back....</p>\n<p>By the way, a viewer is included in the patch. It is more convient for debug. There are 2 display windows: the left one displays the rendered image, the right one displays selected&nbsp;intermediate result out from filter. Read the codes in Svgfilter.sc, you will see how to do...</p>\n<p>Vincent</p>",
