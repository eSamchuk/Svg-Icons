The XNA GraphicsDevice class doesn't seem to even slightly resemble the Graphics class so I'm not sure an easy port would even be possible.</p>\r\n<p>There must be some 2D based XNA APIs that can be used but again, I don't know about that.</p>\r\n<p>Sorry about that!</p>\r\n<p>Cheers<br>Scriv</p>",
