Inkscape (probably for very good reasons) renders ellipses using several Arc segments rather than a single &lt;ellipse/&gt; or &lt;circle/&gt; element and this project doesn't yet support Arc segments. There is a work item to support this though, - <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/svg/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=6455\">#<span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_TabContentPanel_Content_WorkItemDetailsControl_DetailsSidebar_IssueIdLabel\">6455 </span><span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_TabContentPanel_Content_TitlePanel\"><span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_TabContentPanel_Content_TitleLabel\">Arc Segments in SvgPathBuilder.</span></span></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you browse to that and 'Vote' to have the work item fixed it will at least bump it up the priority cue. I <em>will</em> try to get arcs implemented when I can get the time. Sorry 'bout these issues!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers,<br>\r\nDave<br>\r\n",

Try this latest code out if you can and hopefully it will sort most of the issues you and others have been having with Inkscape ellipses :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers,<br>\r\nDave<br>\r\n",
