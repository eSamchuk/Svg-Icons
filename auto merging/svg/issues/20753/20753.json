    "Description": "Hello\n\nI'm developing a web application which helps defining diagrams from svg basic shapes. When I render the diagram server side I open the shapes composing it with `SvgDocument.Open` and draw them on a surface. All good, it works, but every now and then (actually _pretty frequently_), and with no difference at all with other normal executions, `SvgDocument.Open` silently fails and returns a `null` value. I tried several overloads, and right now I'm trying to remove the responsibility of reading the file from __Svg__, I read it myself and supply it to the method as an `XmlDocument`, this way I'm sure there's no concurrency issue on the shape files I read. When the problem happens I can see from debugger that the `XmlDocument` I supply is ok, and it contains the body of the shape, but still the method returns a `null` document.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks\n\nRoberto",
