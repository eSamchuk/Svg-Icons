Also by the way change x, y, dx, dy properties to coordinates list to compliant with svg 1.1 spec,\r\n and add rotate property to enrich it. Still far away from complete svg 1.1 spec but should be more useful... have a try (down load from&nbsp;patch ID: 12378)&nbsp;if you are interested and let me know in case of problems (the examples in svg 1.1 spec were\r\n tested, but still quite limited tests, might have bugs still...)</p>\r\n<p>Vincent</p>\r\n",
