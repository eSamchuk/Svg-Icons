      "Message": "Hmmm that's a good question. Looking through the code I haven't made a way to do this without modifying code unfortunately; the HTTP handler you would use will only display an image of an SVG document on disk. For some stupid reason I didn't make it extensible enough to be able to load from any source through inheritance!!\r\n\r\nI've created work item #10260 with some details about this task. If you don't want to wait for this feel free to give me a shout and we can work on a solution to suit you faster.",
