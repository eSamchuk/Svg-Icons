    "Description": "First time using this library - evaluating to see how I might make some button controls that take SVG rather than bitmap etc.\n \nUsing Inkscape to make shapes for a GUI. Found one that didn't render correctly with this library.\n \nSample shape attached to replicate the problem. (Should be a diamond with curved edges, but also with a hole in the middle).\n \nAfter investigating it seems that the problem is when a path contains a closepath (z) followed by a relative moveto (m). The SVG documentation says:\n \n*** If a \"closepath\" is followed immediately by a \"moveto\", then the \"moveto\" identifies the start point of the next subpath. ***\n \nIt doesn't differentiate between M and m.\n \nSo I tried a mod to the code. If closepath was the last command, and the next command is moveto (M or m) then I add a SvgMoveToSegment using the last known sub-path start point. This fixes the problem. I don't know whether there is more involved to cover other cases, or whether the developer's here think this isn't a bux, but maybe an Inkscape problem, etc.\n \nThanks - Jon.",
