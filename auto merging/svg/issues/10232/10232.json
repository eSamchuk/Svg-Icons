    "Description": "My SVG documents were taking 4 to 5 minutes to open when debugging.  The IDE and app were almost totally locked up the entire time.  I commented out the calls to TraceInformation in the SvgElementFactory code and now it takes less than a second to open the same files.  Turns out sending a trace before and after every element creation was taking up a huge amount of time.",

      "Message": "Ah, yes. This does happen with large SVG files!\r\n\r\nI probably should have used Debug.Write instead of Trace.Write there so that it never happened in a release build. It's probably easier to remove the TRACE constant from project properties and then rebuild so that the Trace statements are never compiled - this will speed up the code as much as possible when you don't want tracing!\r\n\r\nThanks for bringing it up as an issue though, it should only be tracing when somebody wants to debug (so should be debug not trace! heh).",
