    "Description": "Add support for the SVG <image/> element. Attached is basic support, but doesn't implement the preserveAspectRatio element. It parses it, and you'll see a placeholder for it, I just didn't acutally implement the resize. Shouldn't be hard to do, there's a marker in the code where we create the actual Image object, so the resize just needs to go there.",
