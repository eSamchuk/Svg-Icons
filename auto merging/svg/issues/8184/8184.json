    "Description": "Admittedly, I'm not that adept with graphics, and I only spent about 30 minutes on this, so I'm not sure if this is the *right* way to do this.\n \nI just prototyped a way to embed SVG graphics in WinForms application via the Piccolo.NET toolkit (http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/jazz/).  I explained what I did here: http://groups.google.com/group/piccolo2d-users/browse_thread/thread/4332fc25c1109e7d?hl=en\n \nIt seemed like the renderer was primarily geared towards images, so I added this method to SvgRenderer.  \n \n        public static SvgRenderer FromGraphics(Graphics graphics) \n        { \n            SvgRenderer renderer = new SvgRenderer(); \n            renderer._innerGraphics = graphics; \n            return renderer; \n        }",
