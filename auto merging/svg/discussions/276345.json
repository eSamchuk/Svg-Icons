Essentially for each property that is marked as [SvgAttribute] the TypeConverter for is used to convert the value to a string (which is assumed to be the SVG string). This means that types that don't have a TypeConverter defined won't be written properly. It should be pretty easy to fill in any missing TypeConverters though. Hopefully that would be the only work left to do, but I'm not sure of that.</p>\r\n<p>Let me know how you go with this or if there is something that doesn't make sense.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,<br />Dave&nbsp;</p>",

I suspect this will be a relatively simple (but not&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;easy) fix in <strong>SvgElement.cs.WriteAttributes</strong> &amp; other Write* methods. At first glance it appears that the problem is related to the SVG namespace not being written out correctly first. Overriding WriteAttributes in SvgDocument.cs or SvgFragment.cs and writing the XMLNS first could be the correct fix for this.</p>\r\n<p>The second problem is that all attributes are being written out regardless of whether they have been modified. This shouldn't break anything because the default values are all correct according to the SVG spec, but it will create very verbose files.</p>\r\n<p>As to the TypeConverter at work - it's quite easy to spot the issue here in the clip-rule attribute. The valid value would be \"non-zero\" (I think) but the SvgClipRule enum has no TypeConverter so the enum value .ToString() method is used to get a string value (NonZero is how it's represented in code). To fix this issue you'd just need to create a simple TypeConverter for SvgClipRule that overrides the CanConvertTo method to return true for types of string and then override the ConvertTo method to return the correct values. You can see examples of how this is done in SvgUnitConverter.cs and SvgTransformConverter.cs (and see SvgUnit to see how the TypeConverter is registered at the top of the class).</p>\r\n<p>I don't think there is much work left to do here, but it's obviously not in a working state.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,<br />Dave</p>",
