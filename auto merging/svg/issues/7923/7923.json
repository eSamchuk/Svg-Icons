    "Description": "Using the Managed Extensibility Framework will allow new elements to be supported in a much simpler manner. It will also allow greater extensibility of the SVG rendering functionality potentially allowing other rendering engines (e.g. MathML/ChemML) to be built on top of the basic SVG functionality.",
