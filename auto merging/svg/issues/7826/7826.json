    "Description": "Now that most of the major SVG viewers support some filters bringing SVG closer to this level of functionality would be beneficial.\nÂ \nThere are many filters but the most common appears to be gaussian blur (note that there are several filters involved in using a blur for a shadow so this implementation would have to include those).",
