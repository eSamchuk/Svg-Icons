    "Html": "I'm wanting to use SVG images for toolbar/menu icons in the application base I'm working on.  As envisioned, one SVG file might provide several different sizes, say 16x16 and 24x24.  But I need a way to scale the image correctly.  As is, I don't know how large the SVG is.  (Not something I can control.)  So without that, I have no way to specify a scale transform.\r<br />\n<br />\nBTW: It would be cool if the image was able to animate on mouse over.  Imagine a File Open icon that looks like a folder.  With the mouse overhead, the folder opens some.  With the mouse gone, it closes.  Or perhaps the icons would glow.  I don't know if this library supports anything more than a static render though.<br />\n",
