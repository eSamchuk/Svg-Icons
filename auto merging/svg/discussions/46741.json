I just didn't see them at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll send along the &lt;image/&gt; support, and also a couple other minor additions; I've added support for &quot;TransformedBounds&quot; on all elements, which allowed me to get the transformed bounds on the document, which in turn means you can &quot;trim&quot; the image to remove any excess space. Handy for what I'm working on, I bet others could use it as well. It's implemented as Draw(int padding) which draws the image trimmed, with a [padding] width of spacing (so you don't have to trim right to the edge).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo new work items:<br>\r\n<span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_RightSideBar_WorkItemDetailsControl_DetailsSidebar_IssueIdLabel\">#9367</span> - image element<br>\r\n#<span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_RightSideBar_WorkItemDetailsControl_DetailsSidebar_IssueIdLabel\">9368</span> - support for getting the transformed element sizes and trimming the document on draw<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for the work Dave, great library :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Jerod<br>\r\n",
